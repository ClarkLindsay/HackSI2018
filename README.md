Arduino and Processing code for robot control

Here is all the code I used. The Processing code is mostly ripped from the internet with minor adjustments for my robot. The Arduino code is 75% mine but came from the same site. The continuous rotation code is straight from the internet and I used it to see if I had done the hardware conversions correctly.
